# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands

- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript (outputs to dist/)
- `npm run start` - Run the compiled application
- `npm run dev` - Watch mode for development (recompiles on file changes)
- `npm test` - Run tests (not yet configured)

## Architecture

This is a Node.js/TypeScript project with a simple structure:

- `src/` - TypeScript source files
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output (generated by build)
- Entry point: `src/index.ts`
